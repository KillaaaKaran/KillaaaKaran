•Hi, I’m KillaaaKaran.
•I’m studying Further Maths, Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, not so much in coding but its nice to know and learn, and also make my uni applications look interesting with this as a reference
•I’m currently learning how to use Python like I am the most amateur programmer in the world since I never studied Comp Sci in skl or got interested init.
•I’m looking to collaborate on idrk. I just wanted someplace to dump a few of my coded projects like my electronnumberfinder. I will make it all open source so everyone can have fun with it.
•How to reach me, comment on github if they even do that.
•Fun fact: ... Idrk imma just make a list of some interesting things about me:
- Played badminton for 3 years won a few school competitions. My favourite player is Lee Chong Wei
- Can play the harmonica to a decent standard
- I draw and sketch in my free time, I also design models and liveries on Gran Turismo
- I really like Gran Turismo and sim racing, also Valorant
- I play chess sometimes... I would like to learn to get better but i barely have enough free time
- I played basketball for 3 months
- Bayern Munich Fan, favourite player: Emanuel Neuer.
- Fan of F1, favourite driver: Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.
- Was a Goalkeeper for a month. That was boring tbh
- I know 3 irl languages but only fluently speaks 2.
yh thats about it.

Why am I doing this?
Well I have friends in Comp Sci that convinced me to learn a coding language, so Imma stick to python since I can't be bothered to learn anything else.
I post my projects on Github so I can show friends easily and also to use it as a reference in applications to stuff.
In conclusion, This basically sums it up nicely:
